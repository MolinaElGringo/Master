## Task 0 Set up the development environment on your machine

The setup of the development environment consists of the steps
detailed below. If you run into trouble, please consult the
[Google App Engine Java 11 Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java11/quickstart).

1. Make sure your computer has
   [Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
   installed.

   Note : update/set your path environment variable

    ```
    [INPUT]
    java --version
    
    [OUTPUT]
    java 11.0.22 2024-01-16 LTS
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.22+9-LTS-219)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.22+9-LTS-219, mixed mode)
    ```

2. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/).

3. Download and install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/).

   After you download and install invoke the following commands:

   ```
   gcloud init
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
  
   Note : update may requested using "gcloud components update". It can take a while ;(.

4. Install the Cloud SDK `app-engine-java` component:
   ```
   gcloud components install app-engine-java
   ```
5. You must have Maven 3.8 installed. Determine whether Maven 3.8 is
   installed by invoking the following command:

   mvn -v

   If you don't have the proper version of Maven installed:

   - [Download](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) Maven 3.8 from
     the Maven website.
   - [Install](http://maven.apache.org/install.html) Maven 3.8 on
     your local machine.

   Note: Linux users may need to download Maven instead of using
   `apt-get install` to install Maven 3.8.

6. Download and install **IntelliJ Ultimate** 2022.3.3 that
   you will find on the
   [Jetbrains IntelliJ download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/download/).
   If you don't have a student license already, you can ask for one
   [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students).

7. Install the plugin Google Cloud Code for IntelliJ:

   - On the **Welcome to IntelliJ** window, select **Plugins**.
   - Search for [**Google Cloud Code**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8079-gemini--google-cloud-code) and click on **Install**.
   - IntelliJ might have the old **Google App Engine Plugin** bundled. You must disable it if so.
